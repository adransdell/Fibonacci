// Problem: Needs to know all Fibonacci numbers up until user inputs
// Solution: Create Program that allows user to enter number and recieve Fibonacci Numbers


//Create a number sequence starting with 0 and 1
var beginSequence = [0 , 1];
var answer = beginSequence[0] + beginSequence[1];

// Add first numbers in sequence together

 console.log(answer);
//Use sum of numbers to add to previous number to get the next sum

//Repeat
